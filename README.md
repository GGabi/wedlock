# Wedlock

An ergonomic keyboard layout inspired by [Heart](https://github.com/mindhatch/heart) and [Canary](https://github.com/Apsu/Canary).

```
w c d l k  j f o u '
r s t h v  y n e i a
q b g m x  z p / , .
```

## Design

- Prioritise `TH` bigram
  - which is the most common (by far) in English
- Right hand is very similar to the much loved (and tested) Canary layout
- RSTH homerow favours inward-rolls
- Most common non-homerow characters are pushed to the top row whenever possible, minimising scissoring

## Basic Stats

- ~1% SFB
- 47%:53% hand usage without Space, left-hand Space evens this out nicely
- Middle fingers are most used on both hands

## Variations

### Wedlock GB

This design simply swaps the B and G keys to lower SfBs even further. This increases left ring finger usage and makes the BL scissor even worse.

```
w c d l k  j f o u '
r s t h v  y n e i a
q g b m x  z p / , .
```

### Wedlock Q

Swap the Q and ' keys to gain the QU roll. This introduces a QUA redirect.

```
w c d l k  j f o u q
r s t h v  y n e i a
' b g m x  z p / , .
```

### Skewbald (Wedlobk)

Swap the C and B keys to remove the BL scissor but gain the CL scissor. I don't use this because I value the CD roll as a developer.

```
w b d l k  j f o u '
r s t h v  y n e i a
q c g m x  z p / , .
```

### Can I Have Them ALL?

Ofc mix and match variations as you please. Why are you asking for permission?
