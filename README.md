# Wedlock

An ergonomic keyboard layout inspired by [Heart](https://github.com/mindhatch/heart) and [Canary](https://github.com/Apsu/Canary).

## Design

- Prioritise `TH` bigram
  - which is the most common (by far) in English
- Right hand is very similar to the much loved (and tested) Canary layout
- RSTH homerow favours inward-rolls
- Most common non-homerow characters are pushed to the top row whenever possible, minimising scissoring

## Basic Stats

- ~1% SFB
- 48%:52% hand usage without Space, left-hand Space evens this out nicely
- Middle fingers are most used on both hands
